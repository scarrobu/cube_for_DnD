# cube_for_DnD

**TASK:**

Write a script that rolls the selected dice for me, the last throw and the history of the throws are displayed in window.

**SOLUTION:**

It uses just random module and tkinter for create window. The value of the cube is written in the upper window and roll is pressed! In the bottom window is the last selected throw and below it is the history of sent throws from the newest to the oldest.

**NOTE:**

My first use of ktinter, first attempt to work in window, not in the console.
